## Project Overview

Based Math Game is an educational web application designed to help users master number base conversion between Binary (Base 2), Octal (Base 8), Decimal (Base 10), and Hexadecimal (Base 16). The application features both singleplayer and multiplayer modes, comprehensive tutorials, progress tracking, and global leaderboards.

## Key Features

### Game Modes
- **Singleplayer Mode**: 48 official pre-configured game modes plus custom Playground mode
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Real-time competitive rooms with live scoring
- **Playground Mode**: Fully customizable quiz settings (conversions, ranges, duration)

### Learning Resources
- **Tutorials**: Interactive tutorials for each number base with live converters
- **How to Play**: Comprehensive guide covering all game features and mechanics

### Progress Tracking
- **Stats Page**: Personal analytics with game history and performance trends
- **Leaderboards**: Global rankings for each official game mode
- **Guest Mode**: Play without account, with option to sign up for permanent stats

### Authentication
- **Guest Users**: Instant play without registration (localStorage-based)
- **Email/Password**: Traditional account creation
- **Google Sign-In**: OAuth authentication
- **Account Linking**: Convert guest account to permanent account

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.2.0, TypeScript 5.2.2, Vite 7.1.7
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.3, shadcn UI components
- **Backend**: Firebase (Realtime Database, Authentication, Hosting, Analytics)
- **Routing**: React Router 6
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **PWA**: Service Worker, Web Manifest

## Game Mechanics

### Base Conversion
- Questions randomly generated from configured settings
- Support for all combinations of Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal
- Configurable number ranges per conversion type
- Real-time answer validation

### Scoring System
- +1 point per correct answer
- Combo multiplier for consecutive correct answers
- Time bonus in multiplayer mode (faster = more points)
- Wrong answers break combo streak

### Official Game Modes (48 Total)

**Timed Modes** - Complete as many questions as possible within the time limit:
- **15 Second Modes** (12 modes): Binary, Octal, Hex, All Bases × Easy (0-15), Medium (0-255), Hard (0-4095)
- **60 Second Modes** (12 modes): Binary, Octal, Hex, All Bases × Easy (0-15), Medium (0-255), Hard (0-4095)

**Speed Run Modes** - Race to complete a target number of questions:
- **10 Question Sprint** (12 modes): Binary, Octal, Hex, All Bases × Easy (0-15), Medium (0-255), Hard (0-4095)
- **30 Question Marathon** (12 modes): Binary, Octal, Hex, All Bases × Easy (0-15), Medium (0-255), Hard (0-4095)

All modes feature bi-directional conversions (e.g., Binary→Decimal and Decimal→Binary)

## Guest User System

- No Firebase Anonymous Authentication (uses localStorage + Realtime Database)
- Guest UIDs format: `guest_{timestamp}_{random}`
- Full multiplayer support (create/join rooms)
- Stats tracked locally and in database
- Cannot appear on global leaderboards
- Seamless upgrade to permanent account

## API & Data Structure

### Firebase Realtime Database
- `/users/{uid}` - User profiles and stats
- `/leaderboards/{gameModeId}/{uid}` - Global leaderboard entries
- `/rooms/{roomId}` - Multiplayer room data
- `/presence/{uid}` - User online/offline status
- `/gameModes` - Official game mode configurations

### Security Rules
- Guest users can read/write own data
- Guest users cannot write to global leaderboards
- Authenticated users have full access to own data
- All users can read leaderboards and game modes
- Room hosts control game state

## Development

### Local Setup
```bash
npm install
# Configure .env with Firebase credentials
npm run dev  # Start dev server on localhost:5173
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
npm run build  # TypeScript + Vite build → dist/
firebase deploy  # Deploy to Firebase Hosting
```

### Firebase Emulators
```bash
firebase emulators:start  # Auth (9099), Database (9000), UI (4000)
```
